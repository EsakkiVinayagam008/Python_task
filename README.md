<h1>Python Tasks</h1>
<h3>Task 1 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included). </p>
<h3>Task 2 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.  [ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
Expected Output :
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius
</p>
<h3>Task 3 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9.  
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.
</p>
<h3>Task 4 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

<h3>Task 5 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.  </p>
<h3>Task 6 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
Note : Use 'continue' statement.

</p>
<h3>Task 7 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50 .
</p>
<h3>Task 8 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".</p>
<h3>Task 9 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters.
</p>
<h3>Task 10 :</h3>
<p>Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users.  Validation :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].</li>
    <li>At least 1 number between [0-9].</li>
     <li>At least 1 character from [$#@].</li>
     <li>Minimum length 6 characters.</li>
     <li>Maximum length 16 characters.</li>
  </ul>
